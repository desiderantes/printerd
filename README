printerd is a daemon to manage local and remote printers on Linux.

It is a polkit-aware system activatable D-Bus service.

To play around with it, after running 'make install' you can run the
daemon as root in verbose mode from the command line:

su -c '/usr/local/libexec/printerd -v'

Now you can interact with it using the supplied "pd-client" tool, or
with d-feet:

Note that currently there is no SELinux policy for printerd so when
submitting files for printing you will need to enable permissive mode
using "setenforce 0".

The D-Bus objects are:

  Manager: for creating print queues with a specific device URI

  Device: a detected printer device

  Printer: a print queue

  Job: a print job

The Device object provides a method for creating a Printer object for
it.  The Printer object provides a method for creating a job.

To print a file, the Printer object's CreateJob method is called.
This returns an object path for the new job.  The new Job object's
AddDocument method is used to add a file to the job, and finally the
Job object's Start method is used to allow the job to be processed.

The core IPP concepts are used for job and printer states, state
reasons, and so on.  The plan is that an IPP server could be built
out-of-process, which would be a client for the printerd D-Bus
interface.
